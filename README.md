Part of Intro to Programming Test. Created in 2 hours

Purpose: You are required to develop a Python program that converts temperatures between Fahrenheit and Celsius, and provides an analysis based on a single temperature reading. 
The program will allow the user to input a temperature and convert it to the other scale. Additionally, the program should give advice based on the temperature entered.

What I learnt and remember:
Try-Except ValueError >>> It's something I have read but never got the chance to use it till now. It can be used to prevent input of a different Data Types
